With the <strong>Fiscal Year 2025/26</strong> bringing new updates to the Income Tax Act, business owners have fresh opportunities to optimize their tax position.</p><p>Effective tax planning isn&#39;t about evasion—it&#39;s about leveraging the law to reinvest your hard-earned profits back into your growth. Here are five strategic moves every Nepali SME should consider this year.</p><h2 id="_1-optimize-your-presumptive-tax-regime-selection" tabindex="-1">1. Optimize Your Presumptive Tax Regime Selection <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-optimize-your-presumptive-tax-regime-selection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. Optimize Your Presumptive Tax Regime Selection&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For smaller entities, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) offers a simplified &quot;Presumptive Tax&quot; scheme. Choosing the right tier here is critical.</p><ul><li><strong>Turnover up to NPR 3 Million</strong>: You pay a flat tax (e.g., NPR 7,500 in metro areas). This saves massive administrative costs.</li><li><strong>Turnover NPR 3M - 10M</strong>: You pay a percentage of turnover (usually 1%).</li></ul><p><strong>Strategy</strong>: If your profit margins are <strong>low</strong> (e.g., trading goods with thin margins), the presumptive turnovers tax is beneficial. However, if you are running at a loss or have very high operational costs, opting for a normal audit-based filing (where you pay tax only on <em>net profit</em>) might actually result in <strong>zero tax</strong>. Calculate both before registering.</p><h2 id="_2-leverage-section-11-exemptions" tabindex="-1">2. Leverage Section 11 Exemptions <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-leverage-section-11-exemptions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2. Leverage Section 11 Exemptions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Many SMEs miss out on &quot;Section 11&quot; tax holidays because they assume they don&#39;t qualify. The FY 2025/26 budget has expanded these scopes:</p><ul><li><strong>Startups</strong>: If verified by the Department of Industry, startups (turnover &lt; 100M) can enjoy a <strong>100% income tax exemption for 5 years</strong>.</li><li><strong>IT &amp; Exports</strong>: Exporting IT services (BPO, software, design) entitles you to a <strong>75% exemption</strong>, effectively lowering your tax rate to just ~5%.</li><li><strong>Manufacturing</strong>: Special industries get a <strong>20% discount</strong> on the applicable rate.</li></ul><h2 id="_3-strategic-asset-purchasing-depreciation" tabindex="-1">3. Strategic Asset Purchasing (Depreciation) <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-strategic-asset-purchasing-depreciation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3. Strategic Asset Purchasing (Depreciation)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In Nepal, <em>when</em> you buy an asset matters as much as <em>what</em> you buy.</p><ul><li><strong>First 6 Months (Shrawan - Poush)</strong>: Claim <strong>100%</strong> depreciation for the year.</li><li><strong>Next 3 Months (Magh - Chaitra)</strong>: Claim <strong>2/3rds</strong>.</li><li><strong>Last 3 Months (Baishakh - Ashad)</strong>: Claim only <strong>1/3rd</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>Strategy</strong>: If you are planning to buy a delivery van (Pool C) or computers (Pool B), ensure the purchase happens <strong>before Poush end</strong>. This maximizes your deductible expenses for the current year, lowering your taxable income. Manufacturing companies also get an <strong>additional 1/3rd</strong> depreciation allowance—ensure you claim it!</p><h2 id="_4-master-the-loss-carry-forward" tabindex="-1">4.

Master the &quot;Loss Carry Forward&quot;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Business is cyclical. If you faced a loss this year, the Income Tax Act allows you to carry this loss forward for <strong>7 years</strong> to offset future profits.</p><ul><li><em>Example</em>: If you lost NPR 5 Lakhs in Year 1 and made NPR 8 Lakhs profit in Year 2, your taxable income in Year 2 is only 3 Lakhs (8 - 5).</li></ul><p><strong>Strategy</strong>: Ensure your audit report clearly documents losses. Without proper documentation and filing, the IRD will not allow you to offset these losses in profitable years.</p><h2 id="_5-compliance-as-a-cost-saving-tool" tabindex="-1">5.
