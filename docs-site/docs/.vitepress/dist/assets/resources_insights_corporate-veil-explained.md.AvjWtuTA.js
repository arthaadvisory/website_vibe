This means:</p><ul><li>The company is a distinct legal person, separate from its shareholders and directors.</li><li>It can own property, sue, and be sued in its own name.</li><li>Shareholders change, but the company remains.</li></ul><h3 id="the-classic-case-salomon-v-salomon-co-1897" tabindex="-1">The Classic Case: <em>Salomon v Salomon &amp; Co (1897)</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-classic-case-salomon-v-salomon-co-1897" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Classic Case: *Salomon v Salomon &amp; Co (1897)*&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This principle was cemented in the famous case of <em>Salomon v Salomon &amp; Co</em>. Mr. Salomon converted his shoe business into a company. He was the majority shareholder and also a secured creditor (debenture holder). When the company went bankrupt, other creditors argued that Salomon and the company were the same person, so he shouldn&#39;t be paid first.</p><p><strong>The House of Lords ruled:</strong></p><blockquote><p>&quot;The company is at law a different person altogether from the subscribers... and though it may be that after incorporation the business is precisely the same as before, and the same persons are managers... the company is not in law the agent of the subscribers.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This established that a company is not just an alias for its owner.
