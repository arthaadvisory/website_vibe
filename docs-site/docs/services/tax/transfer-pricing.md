## Why TP Compliance Matters
*   **Avoid Double Taxation:** Improper pricing can lead to tax adjustments in Nepal while tax has already been paid in the parent country.
*   **Mitigate Penalities:** Section 117-120 penalties for "tax avoidance" schemes can exceed the tax amount itself.
*   **Operational Smoothness:** Compliant TP documentation ensures smoother repatriation of royalties and dividends.
