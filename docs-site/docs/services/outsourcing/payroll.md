Managing payroll in Nepal is no longer just about cutting checks. With the mandatory implementation of the **Social Security Fund (SSF)** and increasing IRD scrutiny on TDS, compliance is critical. **Artha Advisory** manages your entire payroll cycle, accurately, confidentially, and on time.

## Our Payroll Mandate

### 1. Monthly Payroll Processing
We calculate gross to net pay, factoring in:
*   Statutory TDS (Tax Deductible at Source) as per latest slabs.
*   Employee and Employer **SSF Contributions (11% + 20%)**. Use our **[SSF Contribution Calculator](/resources/tools/calculators)** for simulations.
*   Overtime (OT) and Bonus calculations as per the *Labor Act*.

### 2. Statutory Filings & Payments
We handle the administrative burden of:
*   Preparing and uploading e-TDS returns to the IRD portal.
*   E-filing monthly SSF schedules.
*   Managing **Gratuity & Leave** provisions as per actuarial norms.

### 3. Confidential Executive Payroll
A specialized service for senior management and expatriates where payroll data is handled directly by our partners, ensuring absolute confidentiality within your organization.
