For large corporations and factories, manual asset tracking is a nightmare. **Artha Advisory** provides a modern, technology-driven approach to **Fixed Asset Management (FAM)**, ensuring your physical footprint matches your financial reporting.

## The Artha FAM Solution

### 1. Physical Verification & Tagging
Our field teams perform wall-to-wall physical verification of your assets across all locations. We use **QR/Barcoded Tags** to ensure each asset has a unique, digital identity linked to your ERP.

### 2. Asset Register Reconstruction
Is your Fixed Asset Register (FAR) a messy spreadsheet? We rebuild it from scratch, ensuring compliance with **NAS 16 (Property, Plant, and Equipment)**, including accurate calculation of depreciation and impairment.

### 3. Reconciliation & Audit Support
We perform the trilateral reconciliation between:
1.  Physical Reality (What's on the floor)
2.  Legal Records (Purchase bills/contracts)
3.  Accounting Ledgers (Financial books)
