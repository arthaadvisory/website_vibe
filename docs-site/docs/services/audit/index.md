## Value-Driven Assurance
Artha Advisory moves beyond the traditional "tick-box" approach to audit. We view the audit process as a diagnostic tool—an opportunity to stress-test your business controls, identify operational leakage, and provide **actionable intelligence** that strengthens your organization.

Our methodology is risk-based, technology-driven, and strictly aligned with *International Standards on Auditing (ISA)* and *Nepal Standards on Auditing (NSA)*.
