In a digital-first economy, your IT infrastructure is your most valuable asset—and your biggest vulnerability. **Artha Advisory's Technology Risk Team** helps you safeguard data, ensure uptime, and meet the stringent compliance mandates of Nepal Rastra Bank.

## Why Do You Need an IS Audit?

1.  **Regulatory Mandate:**
    *   **BFIs:** All Class A, B, and C banks must conduct an annual IS Audit as per the NRB Unified Directive.
    *   **Fintech:** Digital wallets and gateways are subject to periodic security reviews for licensing.
2.  **Customer Trust:** Certification assures your users that their financial data and transactions are safe.
3.  **Risk Mitigation:** Proactively identify vulnerabilities from external threats and internal access risks.
