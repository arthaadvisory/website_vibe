## Transaction Lifecycle Support

### 1. Buy-Side & Sell-Side Advisory
Whether you are an institutional investor seeking entry into the Nepal market or a local founder looking for an exit, we manage the entire process:
*   **Target Search & Origination**: Identifying off-market opportunities.
*   **Information Memorandum (IM)**: Preparing professional profiles for target entities.
*   **Negotiation Strategy**: Structuring earn-outs, escrows, and representations & warranties.

### 2. Valuation & Deal Structuring
Using DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) and Market Multiples to arrive at a fair equity value. We advise on tax-efficient structures (Slump Sale vs. Share Transfer) to maximize net proceeds.

### 3. Regulatory Approvals & Liaison
Coordinating the trilateral approval process for M&A:
*   **Department of Industries (DOI)**: For foreign investment changes.
*   **Inland Revenue Department (IRD)**: For Capital Gains Tax (CGT) assessment.
*   **Office of Company Registrar (OCR)**: For updating share registers.
