Closing a business in Nepal is often more complex than starting one. **Artha Advisory** specializes in the professional, compliant, and orderly liquidation of entities, ensuring that all legal, tax, and labor obligations are met before the final strike-off.

## Navigating the Exit

### 1. Voluntary Liquidation (Winding Up)
Assistance in the legal process under the *Companies Act*. We handle the appointment of liquidators, public notifications, and representation before the **Office of the Company Registrar (OCR)**.

### 2. Tax Clearance & Final Audit
The biggest hurdle to liquidation is obtaining the final **Tax Clearance Certificate**. We audit your historical records, resolve pending assessments, and liaison with the IRD to close your PAN/VAT folders permanently.

### 3. Asset Disposal & Repatriation
For foreign investors, we manage the sale/transfer of local assets and handle the complex **NRB Repatriation Approval** process to ensure your capital returns home safely.
