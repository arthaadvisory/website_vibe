Risk is inherent in business, but in Nepal's volatile regulatory and economic landscape, it must be managed with precision. **Artha Advisory** helps you move from reactive "firefighting" to a proactive **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)** framework that protects your long-term value.

## Our Risk Advisory Portfolio

### 1. Regulatory Risk & Compliance
Audit of your organization against critical laws: *Companies Act, Labor Act, Bonus Act, and Social Security Act*. We provide a **Compliance Dashboard** to ensure zero-penalty operations.

### 2. Internal Financial Controls (IFC)
Reviewing your "Order to Cash", "Procure to Pay", and "Payroll" cycles to minimize leakages, fraud, and material misstatements in financial reporting.

### 3. Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
Developing strategies to keep your business running during external shocks, from political instability and natural disasters to cyber-attacks and supply chain disruptions.
