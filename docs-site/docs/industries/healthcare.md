The healthcare sector in Nepal requires a unique blend of financial transparency and institutional integrity. **Artha Advisory** provides specialized auditing and advisory services to hospitals, diagnostic centers, and medical institutions to help them maintain fiscal health while focusing on patient care.

## Financial Integrity in Healthcare

### 1. Institutional Auditing & Internal Controls
Managing a hospital involves complex revenue streams and high-volume transactions. We focus on:
- **Patient Billing Audits**: Ensuring billing accuracy and verifying that revenue from various departments (OPD, IPD, Surgery, Pharmacy) is correctly recorded.
- **Internal Control Assessment**: Evaluating controls over high-value medical equipment, consumables, and cash collections.
- **Fixed Asset Management**: Specialized tracking and depreciation accounting for medical technology and infrastructure.

### 2. Pharmacy & Consumables Management
Pharmacies within healthcare institutions require rigorous oversight:
- **Stock Management**: Auditing pharmaceutical inventory to prevent leakage, spoilage (expiry), and theft.
- **Procurement Review**: Analyzing drug procurement contracts and supply chain efficiency.
- **Gross Margin Analysis**: Reviewing pharmacy profitability and compliance with drug price regulations.

### 3. Specialized Tax for Medical Institutions
Healthcare taxation in Nepal has specific nuances:
- **Tax for Medical Staff**: Assistance in calculating and managing TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) for visiting consultants and permanent medical staff.
- **VAT on Services**: Navigating the exemptions and taxable components of healthcare services and medical supply imports.
- **Health Service Tax (HST)**: Ensuring correct collection and deposit of health service-specific levies when applicable.

## Strategic Advisory

- **Medical College Compliance**: Financial reporting and compliance for institutions affiliated with universities and regulated by the Medical Education Commission.
- **Feasibility Studies**: Financial projections for new hospital wings, diagnostic centers, or specialized equipment purchases.
- **HR & Payroll for Healthcare**: Managing complex duty-rosters and specialized payroll for healthcare professionals.
