Nepal's insurance sector is undergoing significant structural changes with increased capital requirements and the adoption of risk-based supervision. **Artha Advisory** provides the specialized technical expertise needed to navigate these regulatory shifts.

## Sector-Specific Services

### 1. Statutory & Internal Audit
As a specialized firm, we provide statutory audits that comply with the *Insurance Act 2079* and Nepal Financial Reporting Standards (NFRS 17). Our internal audits focus on:
*   **Actuarial Liability Verification**: Assessing the adequacy of technical reserves.
*   **Reinsurance Audit**: Verifying the legitimacy and settlement of reinsurance claims.
*   **Investment Compliance**: Ensuring investments follow the Nepal Insurance Authority (NIA) guidelines.

### 2. NFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts) Transition
We assist insurance companies in transitioning to the complex NFRS 17 framework, which fundamentally changes how insurance contracts are measured and reported.
*   **Gap Analysis**: Identifying differences between legacy accounting and NFRS 17.
*   **Modeling**: Developing building block approaches for liability measurement and risk adjustment.

### 3. Regulatory Reporting & Compliance
*   **AML/CFT Compliance**: Special audits to ensure compliance with the *Money Laundering Prevention Act*.
*   **Corporate Governance**: Reviewing the effectiveness of the Board and Risk Management Committees as per NIA circulars.
