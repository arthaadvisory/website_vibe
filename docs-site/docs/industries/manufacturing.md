In a competitive market, margin management is critical.
*   **Cost Audit**: Analyzing the "Cost of Production" per unit to identify wastage and improve gross margins.

*   **Overhead Allocation**: Ensuring factory overheads are correctly absorbed into product costing.

### 2. Supply Chain & Inventory
Inventory is often a manufacturer's largest asset—and biggest risk.
*   **Perpetual Inventory System**: Implementing barcode-based tracking for real-time stock visibility.
*   **Stock Audit**: Surprise physical verification of high-value raw materials and WIP.
*   **Vendor Audit**: Reviewing procurement contracts to ensure you aren't overpaying for supplies.

### 3. Excise & Customs Advisory
