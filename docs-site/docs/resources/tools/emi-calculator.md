### Manual Calculation Formula
The formula for EMI is:

$$E = P \times r \times \frac{(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1}$$

Where:
*   **E** = EMI Amount
*   **P** = Principal Loan Amount
*   **r** = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
*   **n** = Loan Tenure in Months

### Example
If you take a **Home Loan** of **NPR 1 Crore** for **20 Years** at **12% Interest**:
*   **Monthly EMI:** ~ NPR 1,10,108
*   **Total Interest Payable:** ~ NPR 1.64 Crore
*   **Total Payment:** ~ NPR 2.64 Crore
