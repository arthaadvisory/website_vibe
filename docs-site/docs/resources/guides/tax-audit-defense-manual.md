# Tax Audit Defense Manual

Receiving a **"Full Audit Notice"** from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) is stressful. But panic leads to mistakes. This manual outlines your rights and strategy during an audit.

## Steps of a Tax Audit

### 1. The Notice
You receive a letter seeking books of accounts for detailed scrutiny.
*   **Action:** Acknowledge receipt. Do *not* ignore it.

### 2. The Field Visit
Tax officers may visit your premises to verify stock and cash.
*   **Strategy:** Be cooperative but limit access to only what is requested. Do not volunteer extra information.

### 3. The "Issues Letter" (Bayan)
The officer will issue a list of discrepancies (e.g., "Why is your Gross Profit lower than last year?").
*   **Defense:** This is your primary chance to explain. Submit a written reply with evidence (ledger copies, industry norms).

### 4. Assessment Order (Pre-Assessment)
If unsatisfied, the officer issues a preliminary tax assessment.
*   **Action:** You have **15 days** to file an objection. This is critical. A weak objection here seals your fate.

### 5. Final Assessment
The officer issues the final tax demand.

## Common Audit Triggers
1.  **Low GP Ratio:** Gross Profit margin significantly lower than industry average.
2.  **Mismatched Data:** VAT Sales $\neq$ Income Tax Sales.
3.  **Large Loans:** High interest expenses with low profitability.
4.  **VAT Credits:** Continually showing VAT receivable (carrying losses) for years.

## Your Rights
*   **Right to Representation:** Your Auditor/Lawyer can speak on your behalf.
*   **Right to Evidence:** You can demand to see the evidence the officer is using against you.
*   **Right to Appeal:** You can appeal to the Director General against the assessment.
