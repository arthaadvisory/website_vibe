### Section 120: The Conceptual Framework

The conceptual framework specifies an approach to identify, evaluate, and address threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.

#### 1. Identify Threats
Threats fall into five categories:

| Threat Category | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Self-interest** | Financial or other interest influences judgment. | Holding shares in a client company. |
| **Self-review** | Evaluating one's own previous work. | Auditing financial statements prepared by oneself. |
| **Advocacy** | Promoting a client's position to the point of compromising objectivity. | Acting as an advocate for a client in litigation. |
| **Familiarity** | Due to a long/close relationship, being too sympathetic. | Long association with a client. |
| **Intimidation** | Deterred from acting objectively due to pressure. | Threat of dismissal over a disagreement. |

#### 2. Evaluate Threats
Determine if the threat is at an **Acceptable Level**.
*   **Acceptable Level**: A reasonable and informed third party would likely conclude that the accountant complies with the fundamental principles.

#### 3. Address Threats
If threats are *not* at an acceptable level, you must:
1.  **Eliminate** the circumstances creating the threat.
2.  **Apply Safeguards** to reduce the threat to an acceptable level.
3.  **Decline or End** the professional activity.

::: warning Bias Awareness
Be aware of biases like **Anchoring**, **Confirmation**, and **Groupthink** that impact professional judgment.
