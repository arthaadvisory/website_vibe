# NGO & INGO Compliance Handbook

Operating a non-profit in Nepal involves navigating a complex web of regulators: the **Social Welfare Council (SWC)**, **District Administration Office (DAO)**, and the **Inland Revenue Department (IRD)**.

This handbook simplifies your compliance obligations.

## 1. Legal Registration & Renewal

### **NGOs (Local)**
*   **Registration:** At the District Administration Office (DAO).
*   **Renewal:** Must be renewed annually (every Fiscal Year).
*   **Key Document:** Tax Clearance Certificate is mandatory for renewal.

### **INGOs (International)**
*   **General Agreement (GA)**: A 3-5 year framework agreement signed with the SWC.
*   **Project Agreement (PA)**: Specific agreement for each project, detailing the budget and district-wise activities.

## 2. Tax Compliance (The Big Confusion)
Many NGOs assume they are "Tax Exempt." **This is false.**

*   **Income Tax:** NGOs are tax-exempt *only on donations/grants* if they have a Tax Exemption Certificate (Dafa 2) from the IRD.
*   **Commercial Income:** If an NGO sells products (e.g., handicrafts) or consultancy, that income is **taxable**.
*   **TDS Obligations:** NGOs must deduct and deposit TDS on:
    *   House Rent (10%)
    *   Staff Salaries (1% Social Security Tax)
    *   Consultancy Fees (15%)
    *   Audit Fees (15%)

## 3. SWC Audit Requirements
The Social Welfare Council has specific audit formats diverging from standard NAS.

### **The "Project Audit" Report**
Unlike a standard financial audit, a Project Audit must verify:
*   **Administrative vs. Program Cost:** Administrative costs must not exceed **20%** of the total budget.
*   **District-Level Expenditure:** Proof that funds were actually spent in the target district.
*   **Social Audit:** A participatory audit involving stakeholders (beneficiaries) to assess impact.
