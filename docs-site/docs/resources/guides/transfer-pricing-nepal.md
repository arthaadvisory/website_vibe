# Transfer Pricing in Nepal: A Guide for Multinational Companies

*Understanding the new "Arm's Length" requirements for cross-border transactions.*

---

As Nepal integrates into the global economy, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has sharpened its focus on **Transfer Pricing (TP)**. For multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in Nepal, this means stricter scrutiny on how you price transactions with your foreign parent companies or subsidiaries.

The **Transfer Pricing Directive 2074** (and subsequent updates) mandates that all "controlled transactions" must be conducted at "Arm's Length Price" (ALP).

<FAQ :items="[
  {
    question: 'What is Transfer Pricing?',
    answer: 'Transfer pricing refers to the prices charged for goods, services, or intellectual property (IP) transferred between related parties (e.g., a subsidiary and its parent company). If these prices are artificial, tax revenue is lost.'
  }
]" />

## The "Arm's Length Principle" (ALP)
The core rule is simple: **You must charge your related company the same price you would charge an independent stranger.**

If you sell a widget to your sister company for NPR 80, but the market price is NPR 100, the IRD will tax you as if you sold it for NPR 100.

## Scope of Controlled Transactions
TP rules cover:
1.  **Tangible Goods**: Purchase/sale of raw materials or finished products.
2.  **Services**: Management fees, IT support, technical assistance fees.
3.  **Intangibles**: Royalties for trademarks, brands, or patents.
4.  **Financing**: Interest rates on inter-company loans.

## Transfer Pricing Methods
Nepal accepts standard OECD methods for calculating ALP:
1.  **Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP)**: Comparing the price directly to market rates (preferred).
2.  **Resale Price Method (RPM)**: Gross margin approach, suitable for distributors.
3.  **Cost Plus Method (CPM)**: Adding a markup to costs, suitable for manufacturers.
4.  **Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)**: Comparing net profit margins (most commonly used).
5.  **Profit Split Method (PSM)**: Splitting profits based on contribution.

## Compliance Requirements
If your related-party transactions exceed certain thresholds, you must maintain **TP Documentation** (a "Local File") containing:
*   Organizational structure.
*   Description of the business and industry.
*   Details of controlled transactions.
*   Functional Analysis (who does what, who takes the risk).
*   Economic Analysis (benchmarking study proving your price is fair).

## Risks of Non-Compliance

    question: 'What are the risks of non-compliance?',
    answer: '<ul class=\'list-disc pl-5\'><li><strong>Adjustments</strong>: IRD can re-calculate taxable income, leading to large demands.</li><li><strong>Penalties</strong>: Fines for missing documentation can equal 100% of the tax evaded.</li><li><strong>Double Taxation</strong>: Paying tax on the same income in both countries if prices are adjusted.</li></ul>'
  }

## Conclusion
Transfer pricing is no longer a theoretical concept in Nepal—it is an active area of tax enforcement. Multinational companies must proactively document their pricing policies to avoid costly disputes.
