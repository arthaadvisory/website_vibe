# NFRS for SMEs in Nepal: A Simplified Guide

*Demystifying the Nepal Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium Enterprises.*

---

The adoption of **Nepal Financial Reporting Standards (NFRS)** is no longer just for banks and multinational corporations. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN) has rolled out specific standards tailored for **Small and Medium-Sized Entities (SMEs)**.

For many business owners, "NFRS" sounds like an expensive compliance headache. In reality, NFRS for SMEs is designed to be **simpler**, **less costly**, and **more relevant** than the full NFRS.

## Applicability & Benefits

<FAQ :items="[
  {
    question: 'Who Qualifies as an SME for NFRS?',
    answer: 'An entity typically qualifies if it has <strong>No Public Accountability</strong> (not listed, not a bank/insurer) and publishes <strong>General Purpose Financial Statements</strong> for external users. <br><em>Note: Micro-entities may follow the simpler \'NAS for Micro Entities\'.</em>'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why should SMEs adopt NFRS?',
    answer: '<ol class=\'list-decimal pl-5\'><li><strong>Bank Loans</strong>: Banks prefer NFRS-compliant statements for credit assessment.</li><li><strong>Comparability</strong>: Easier to compare performance with peers for investors.</li><li><strong>True Profitability</strong>: Accrual accounting provides a more accurate financial picture than cash basis.</li></ol>'
  }

## Key Differences: Full NFRS vs. NFRS for SMEs

| Feature | Full NFRS | NFRS for SMEs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Complexity** | High complexity; covers all complex financial instruments. | Simplified; removes complex options irrelevant to SMEs. |
| **Disclosure** | Extensive disclosure requirements (3,000+ items). | Significantly reduced disclosures (~300 items). |
| **Fair Value** | Heavy reliance on "Fair Value" accounting. | Mostly uses "Historical Cost" (easier to track). |
| **Goodwill** | Tested for impairment annually (complex). | Amortized over 10 years (simple). |
| **Borrowing Costs**| Must be capitalized (added to asset cost). | Must be expensed immediately (simpler). |
| **R&D Costs** | Development costs must be capitalized. | All research & development costs are expensed. |

## Common Challenges in Transition
Transitioning to NFRS for SMEs does require clear steps:
*   **First-Time Adoption**: You must prepare an "Opening Balance Sheet" that restates your previous year's figures under the new rules.
*   **Staff Training**: Your internal accountant may need training to understand concepts like "accruals" vs. "cash flow".
*   **Software**: Ensure your accounting software (Tally, Swastik, QuickBooks) is configured to generate the required reports.

## Conclusion
NFRS for SMEs is a "right-sized" framework. It brings the credibility of international standards without the crushing weight of complex compliance. Embracing it early positions your business as transparent, professional, and ready for growth.
