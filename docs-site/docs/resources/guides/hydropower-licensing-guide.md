# Hydropower Development: Licensing & PPA Guide

Developing a hydropower project in Nepal is a marathon of regulatory hurdles. From the **Department of Electricity Development (DoED)** to the **Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)**, here is your roadmap.

## Phase 1: Survey License (1-2 Years)
*   **Application:** Submit to DoED with a desk study map.
*   **Output:** You get the exclusive right to conduct the Feasibility Study and IEE/EIA.
*   **Compliance:** Must submit semi-annual progress reports to DoED.

## Phase 2: Generation License (The Big One)
To convert your Survey License into a Generation License, you need:
1.  **Approved Feasibility Study:** Technical vetting by DoED.
2.  **EIA/IEE Approval:** Environmental clearance from the Ministry of Forests & Environment.
3.  **Connection Agreement:** A technical agreement with NEA for grid connectivity.
4.  **PPA (Power Purchase Agreement):** The holy grail.

## Phase 3: The PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)
The PPA guarantees your revenue.
*   **Rates (ROR Projects):**
    *   Wet Season: NPR 4.80 per unit.
    *   Dry Season: NPR 8.40 per unit.
*   **Take or Pay:** NEA guarantees to buy your power (subject to dispatch rules).

## Phase 4: Financial Close
Banks typically finance **70%** of the project cost (Debt) against **30%** promoter equity.
*   **Requirement:** PPA, Generation License, and a bankable financial model.
