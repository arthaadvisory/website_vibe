# Guidelines on Marketing Professional Services by Professional Accountants in Public Practice (2023)

*Issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN)*

**Effective Date:** 17 July 2023

---

## 1. Objectives

Marketing of professional services provided by professional accountants in public practice is primarily intended to communicate with clients searching for accountants with adequate qualifications, experience, competence, and good repute.

However, such marketing, publicity, or advertisement may create a threat to compliance with the fundamental principles of the **Code of Ethics**. 
*   *Example:* A self-interest threat to professional behavior arises if services, achievements, or products are marketed in a way inconsistent with the principle.

Therefore, communication must not influence, persuade, or coerce clients through advertisement, publicity, lobbying, etc.

**Professional accountants in practice shall:**
*   Not bring the profession into disrepute when marketing services.
*   Be honest and truthful.
*   **NOT** make exaggerated claims for services, qualifications, or experience.
*   **NOT** make disparaging references or unsubstantiated comparisons to the work of others.

## 2. Marketing, Advertising, or Publicity

*   **Marketing:** A process to communicate with potential clients needing professional services. This may involve newspapers, magazines, signboards, television, radio, social media, websites, etc.
*   **Publicity:** Similar to advertisement but directed at potential or non-potential clients to make them aware that a professional accountant seeks clients.

**Key Restriction:**
The Code of Ethics (IFAC & ICAN) intends to restrain professional accountants from influencing, persuading, or coercing clients through exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims.
