# Tax Holidays & Concessions: Strategic Briefing (FY 2081/82)

*In Nepal's industrial policy, choosing the right location and sector can reduce your effective tax rate from 25% to 0%.*

<ReadTime />

The Government of Nepal offers significant tax incentives to promote key sectors like Hydropower, IT, and Manufacturing. However, these incentives are discretionary and require strict adherence to the *Industrial Enterprises Act* and the *Income Tax Act 2058*.

## � Strategic Comparison Matrix
| Industry Type | Tax Holiday | Post-Holiday Rate | Mandatory Filings |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|

## ⚖️ Critical Compliance Rules
It is a common misconception that these holidays are automatic.
1.  **DOI Registration**: You must be registered as an "Industry" with the Department of Industry.
2.  **Audit Integrity**: Books must be audited in accordance with *NFRS*.
3.  **Active Filing**: You must still file a "D03" tax return annually and explicitly claim the exemption. Failure to file on time can lead to a loss of the exemption for that year.
