*Understanding the legal backbone of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Nepal.*

The **Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act 2075 (2019)**, commonly known as **FITTA**, is the primary legislation governing foreign investment in Nepal. It replaced the 1992 act, introducing significant reforms to simplify processes and attract global capital.

This guide breaks down the key provisions of FITTA 2075 that every foreign investor must know.

## 3. Permitted Sectors & The Negative List
Nepal welcomes FDI in almost all sectors. However, FITTA maintains a **Negative List** of industries explicitly *closed* to foreign investment.

**Restricted Sectors (Negative List):**
1.  **Primary Agriculture**: Poultry, fisheries, beekeeping, dairy processing (unless >75% export).
2.  **Cottage & Small Industries**: Traditional crafts, retail business (excluding international chain retail).
3.  **Personal Services**: Barber shops, tailoring, driving instruction.
4.  **Arms & Ammunition**: Production of weapons or radioactive materials.
5.  **Real Estate**: Buying and selling land/housing (construction industry is allowed).
6.  **Mass Media**: Newspapers, radio, and TV (unless >51% foreign investment limit applies in specific cases).

*Tip: Always check the latest Industrial Enterprise Act for specific definitions of "Cottage Industries".*

## 3. The Approval Process: One-Window Service
FITTA mandates a **One-Window Service Center (OWSC)** located at the Department of Industry (DOI). This center aims to provide:
*   Investment approval.
*   Company registration.
*   Pan/VAT registration.
*   Visa facilitation.

**Investment Thresholds:**
*   **Up to NPR 6 Billion**: Approve via Department of Industry (DOI).
*   **Above NPR 6 Billion**: Approve via Investment Board Nepal (IBN).
