## 🛑 The Challenge

A US-based SaaS company wanted to set up a development center in Kathmandu to tap into local talent. They were concerned about:
1.  **FDI Approval Delays**: Doing Business in Nepal is notoriously slow.
2.  **Repatriation**: Fear of getting profits "stuck" in Nepal due to NRB regulations.
3.  **IP Protection**: Ensuring their code ownership remained in the US.

## 🛠️ The Artha Approach

We acted as their "Local CFO Office," handling everything from the first application to the first payroll.

### Phase 1: Structuring (The "Software Export" Model)
We registered the company under the **Information Technology** category.
*   **Why?**: To avail the **1% Income Tax Rate** on export income (as per Finance Act 2079).

### Phase 2: The Fast-Track FDI
We utilized the *automatic route* (online submission) for the Department of Industry (DOI).
*   **Action**: Prepared a robust "Project Report" highlighting the technology transfer aspect, which accelerated the approval to just 12 days.

### Phase 3: Banking & Forex
We set up a foreign currency account and obtained the "FDI Recording" certificate from Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) *immediately* upon capital inflow.
*   *Crucial Step*: Without this certificate, future repatriation is impossible.

## 💡 The Solution

We built a compliance framework that runs on autopilot:

1.  **Transfer Pricing Policy**: Drafted a "Cost Plus 15%" agreement between the US Parent and Nepal Subsidiary to satisfy tax authorities in both countries.
2.  **Monthly Compliance**: Outsourced payroll and TDS filing to our team.
3.  **Expat Visas**: Secured business visas for the visiting US CTO.

## 🚀 The Impact

*   **Speed**: Company incorporated and operational in **45 days** (vs. industry average of 90 days).
*   **Tax Efficiency**: The company pays an effective tax rate of just **1%** on its revenue.
*   **Security**: Successfully repatriated the first tranche of dividends in 2024 without a single query from the Central Bank.
