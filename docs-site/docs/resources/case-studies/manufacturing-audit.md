## 🛑 The Challenge

A leading steel manufacturing company in the Terai belt was facing declining margins despite rising sales. The management suspected operational inefficiencies but couldn't pinpoint the source. Their existing audit process was purely compliance-based, checking vouchers rather than processes.

**Key Issues Identified:**
*   High raw material consumption (burning loss) compared to industry standards.
*   Unreconciled inventory differences between the factory floor and the SAP system.
*   Delayed procurement cycles causing production halts.

## 🛠️ The Artha Approach

We deployed a specialized "Techno-Commercial" audit team comprising Chartered Accountants and an Industrial Engineer.

### Phase 1: The "Walk-Through"
Instead of sitting in the AC office, our team spent 5 days on the factory floor. We mapped the entire production cycle from *Scrap Intake* to *Billet Production*.

### Phase 2: Data Analytics & Correlation
We correlated electricity consumption data with production output.
*   **Result**: We found that the furnace was running at suboptimal temperatures during night shifts, leading to higher electricity cost per ton.

### Phase 3: Yield Verification
We conducted a surprise physical verification of the "Burning Loss".
*   **Finding**: The claimed burning loss was 8%, while the industry standard was 5%. The difference was being pilfered as "waste".

## 💡 The Solution

We implemented a **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** for the production floor:

1.  **CCTV Integration**: Weighbridges were integrated with CCTV cameras to prevent weight manipulation during scrap entry.
2.  **Yield Monitoring**: Daily yield reports were mandated, with variances above 0.5% requiring a written explanation from the Plant Manager.
3.  **Energy Audit**: Shift-wise power consumption monitoring was introduced.

## 🚀 The Impact

Within 6 months of implementation:

*   **Yield Improvement**: Burning loss reduced from 8% to 5.2%.
*   **Cost Savings**: Direct material savings of **NPR 2.5 Crore** annually.
*   **Process Control**: The "Phantom Inventory" in SAP was eliminated, ensuring 99% stock accuracy.
