**Is your real estate transaction compliant with the latest government directive?**

The Government of Nepal has recently issued the **Money Laundering Prevention and Combating Terrorism Financing Directive, 2082**, introducing stringent measures for high-value transactions, particularly in the real estate sector. This move aims to curb the flow of illicit funds and align Nepal with international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards.

## 🚨 Key Threshold: The 10 Lakh Rule

The most significant change is the introduction of a lower threshold for mandatory "Source of Funds" declarations.

*   **Old Rule:** Scrutiny focused primarily on transactions above NPR 1 Crore.
*   **New Rule:** Any land or property transaction exceeding **NPR 10 Lakhs** now requires the buyer to disclose the legitimate source of income.

## 📝 Mandatory Banking Channels

Cash is no longer king. The directive mandates that any payment for real estate exceeding the specified limit must be routed through banking channels.

*   **Cheques / Drafts / RTGS:** Must be used for the transaction value.
*   **Cash Payments:** Strictly discouraged and may trigger a "Suspicious Transaction Report" (STR) by the Land Revenue Office (Malpot).

## 🏢 Impact on Real Estate Companies

If you are a developer or a housing company, your compliance burden has increased. You are now classified as a **Reporting Entity**. This means you must:
1.  **KYC:** Maintain detailed Know Your Customer records for all buyers.
2.  **Reporting:** Automatically report transactions exceeding NPR 10 Lakhs to the Financial Information Unit (FIU) of Nepal Rastra Bank.
3.  **Risk Assessment:** Conduct an internal risk assessment of your clients.

## ⚠️ Penalties for Non-Compliance

Failure to adhere to these new norms can result in:
*   Freezing of the asset.
*   Fines up to **500% of the transaction value**.
*   Criminal prosecution for money laundering abetment.

## ✅ Action Plan for Buyers & Sellers

1.  **Document Everything:** Keep tax clearance certificates and bank statements ready to prove your income source.
2.  **Use Formal Channels:** Avoid "Undervaluation" (Kaili Chodine) practices. The gap between the Government Valuation and Market Price is being closely monitored.
3.  **Consult Experts:** Before signing that deed, ensure your paper trail is clean.
