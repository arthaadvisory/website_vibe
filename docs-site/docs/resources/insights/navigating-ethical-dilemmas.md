In the complex world of accounting and auditing, the right answer isn't always in a textbook. Professional accountants often face situations where technical rules conflict with ethical principles.

The **ICAN Code of Ethics 2023** provides a **Conceptual Framework** to help professionals navigate these grey areas. It’s not just a set of rules; it’s a mindset.

## The 3-Step Conceptual Framework

Instead of memorizing every possible rule, apply this three-step approach to any situation:

### Step 1: Identify Threats
Ask yourself: *Does this situation compromise my compliance with the fundamental principles?*
*   **Integrity:** Am I being honest?
*   **Objectivity:** Is my judgment clouded?
*   **Professional Competence:** Do I have the skills?
*   **Confidentiality:** Should I keep this secret?
*   **Professional Behavior:** Will this discredit the profession?

**Common Threats:**
*   *Self-Interest:* Owning shares in a client's company.
*   *Self-Review:* Auditing your own work.
*   *Advocacy:* Promoting a client's position too strongly.
*   *Familiarity:* Being too close to a client (e.g., long tenure).
*   *Intimidation:* Being threatened with dismissal.

### Step 2: Evaluate Threats
Not all threats are equal. Evaluate the **significance** of the threat.
*   Is it at an *acceptable level*?
*   Would a "reasonable and informed third party" conclude that your integrity is compromised?

If the threat is not at an acceptable level, you MUST move to Step 3.

### Step 3: Address Threats
You have two options:
1.  **Eliminate the circumstances:** (e.g., sell the shares, refuse the gift).
2.  **Apply Safeguards:** Actions to reduce the threat to an acceptable level.
    *   *Example:* Having a separate partner review the work (Engagement Quality Control Review).

If you cannot eliminate the threat or apply safeguards, you must **decline or discontinue** the engagement.

## Case Study: The "Helpful" Client

**Scenario:** You are auditing *Alpha Industries*. The Finance Director, an old college friend, offers you a "staff discount" of 50% on a new car (Alpha manufactures cars). He implies that future audit contracts depend on maintaining a "friendly relationship."

**Analysis:**
1.  **Identify:**
    *   *Self-Interest:* The discount is a financial benefit.
    *   *Familiarity:* Old college friend.
    *   *Intimidation:* Threat of losing the contract.
2.  **Evaluate:** The discount is significant (50% on a car). The threat to Objectivity and Integrity is HIGH.
3.  **Address:**
    *   *Safeguard:* Disclosing to the audit committee? Unlikely to work given the intimidation.
    *   *Action:* You must **refuse the discount**. If the intimidation persists, you may need to **resign**.

## Conclusion

Ethics is not about being a "good person"; it's about maintaining **Professional Skepticism** and **Independence**. When in doubt, document your thought process using this framework.
