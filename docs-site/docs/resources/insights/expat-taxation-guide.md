Foreign nationals working in Nepal often face confusion regarding their tax liabilities. "Do I pay a flat 25%?" or "Am I subject to social security?" Here is the definitive answer.

## Residency Status is Key

Your tax liability depends on your stay:
*   **Resident:** Stay in Nepal for **183 days or more** in a fiscal year (Ashad to Ashad).
*   **Non-Resident:** Stay for less than 183 days.

## 1. The "Non-Resident" Rule (Flat 25%)
If you are a non-resident (e.g., consultants on short-term missions), you are taxed at a **flat rate of 25%** on your Nepal-sourced income.
*   **Benefit:** No need to file a full tax return if TDS is deducted finally.
*   **Drawback:** No deductions allowed (insurance, remote area, etc.).

## 2. The "Resident" Rule (Progressive Slabs)
If you stay >183 days, you are taxed like a Nepali citizen.
*   **Slab Rates (FY 2081/82 - Married status):**
    *   First 600k: 1% (Social Security Tax)
    *   Next 200k: 10%
    *   Next 300k: 20%
    *   Next 900k: 30%
    *   Above 20L: 36% (if turnover >5M, 39%)

**Surprise:** For high earners, the progressive rate (36%+) is *higher* than the non-resident flat rate (25%).

## 3. Remuneration Tax (The "Expat Concession")
However, Section 87 and Schedule 1 of the Tax Act allows a specific concession. If you are a foreign national employed in Nepal, you **might** opt for specific treatments based on your contract structure. 

*Critical Note:* Often, employers deduct 1% SST, but technically, if you are not a citizen, the 1% SST might not apply in the same way, though practice varies.

## 4. Double Taxation Avoidance (DTAA)
Nepal has DTAA with countries like India, China, UK, USA, etc. Tax paid in Nepal can often be claimed as a credit in your home country. You will need a **Tax Clearance Certificate** from the IRD to prove this layer.

## 5. Repatriating Your Salary
To send money home, you need:
1.  Work Permit (Department of Labour).
2.  Tax Clearance Certificate.
3.  Bank Recommendation.
Without these, your earnings are stuck in NPR.
