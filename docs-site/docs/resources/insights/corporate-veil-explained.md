The primary reason entrepreneurs choose to incorporate a company is **Limited Liability**. This legal shield ensures that if a company fails, the shareholders' personal assets—like their house or car—are generally safe from creditors.

But is this shield impenetrable? Let's explore the cornerstone legal principle of **Separate Legal Entity** and the exceptional circumstances where this "Corporate Veil" is lifted.

## The Principle: Separate Legal Entity

The *Companies Act, 2063* states in Section 7 that a company is an **autonomous body corporate with perpetual succession**. This means:
*   The company is a distinct legal person, separate from its shareholders and directors.
*   It can own property, sue, and be sued in its own name.
*   Shareholders change, but the company remains.

### The Classic Case: *Salomon v Salomon & Co (1897)*

This principle was cemented in the famous case of *Salomon v Salomon & Co*.
Mr. Salomon converted his shoe business into a company. He was the majority shareholder and also a secured creditor (debenture holder). When the company went bankrupt, other creditors argued that Salomon and the company were the same person, so he shouldn't be paid first.

**The House of Lords ruled:**
> "The company is at law a different person altogether from the subscribers... and though it may be that after incorporation the business is precisely the same as before, and the same persons are managers... the company is not in law the agent of the subscribers."

This established that a company is not just an alias for its owner. It is a separate legal person.

## When the Veil is Lifted

While separate personality is the rule, courts and statutes can look behind the corporate facade to hold the individuals (directors/shareholders) personally liable. This is called **"Lifting the Corporate Veil"**.

### 1. Statutory Grounds (Under Nepalese Law)

New provisions in the *Companies Act, 2063* and *Income Tax Act* allow authorities to pierce the veil:

*   **Reduction in Membership (Sec. 14):** If the number of shareholders in a public company falls below 7, it must convert to a private company. Failure to do so may strip protections.
*   **Tax Evasion:** If a company is formed solely to evade tax or circumvent tax obligations, authorities can treat the company's income as the individual's income.
*   **Fraudulent Trading (Sec. 134):** Directors and officers can be held personally liable for acts of deceit or fraud committed against the company or its creditors.

### 2. Judicial Grounds

Courts may lift the veil in specific situations:

*   **Fraud or Improper Conduct:** If a company is used as a "cloak or sham" to commit fraud or avoid legal obligations.
    *   *Example:* An employee bound by a "non-compete" clause forms a company to solicit former clients. The court will stop the company just as it would the individual.
*   **Agency or Trust:** Where a company is a mere puppet or agent of its controlling shareholder, the principal (shareholder) may be held liable for the agent's (company's) acts.
*   **Enemy Character:** In times of war, courts may check if a company is controlled by "enemy aliens," even if registered locally.

## Conclusion for Business Owners

Incorporation offers significant protection, but it is not a license to act recklessly or fraudulently.

::: danger Key Takeaway
The "Corporate Veil" protects honest failures, not calculated fraud.
:::

As a director or shareholder, always ensure:
1.  **Corporate Formalities** are maintained (minutes, filings).
2.  **Company Assets** are not treated as personal piggy banks.
3.  **Statutory Duties** under the Companies Act are strictly followed.
