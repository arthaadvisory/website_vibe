Is your business a "Startup" in the eyes of the government? If yes, you might be sitting on a goldmine of incentives. The Government of Nepal has introduced specific definitions and benefits to foster entrepreneurship.

## 1. What qualifies as a "Startup"?

According to the **Startup Enterprise Loan Fund Procedure 2079**, your business must meet these criteria:
*   **Age:** Registered for less than 7 years.
*   **Capital:** Paid-up capital less than NPR 50 Lakhs.
*   **Revenue:** Annual turnover less than NPR 50 Lakhs.
*   **Full-Time Staff:** Not more than 10 employees.
*   **Innovation:** Must use creative thinking or technology in production/service.

## 2. The 25 Lakh Subsidized Loan

Qualified startups can apply for a project loan up to **NPR 25 Lakhs** at a subsidized interest rate (currently around 3%).
*   **Collateral:** The project itself (no land/building collateral required).
*   **Process:** Applications are called annually by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies.
*   **Selection:** Based on proposal evaluation (viability, job creation, innovation).

## 3. Tax Holidays (Section 11)

The Income Tax Act provides massive relief for specific sectors:

### **IT & Tech Companies**
*   **50% Income Tax Exemption** for 5 years if you export software/services.
*   **1% Tax Rate** regarding recent Finance Acts for BPO/KPO (subject to annual changes).

### **Manufacturing & Special Industries**
*   **30% to 100% Exemption** for industries established in underdeveloped regions.
*   **10 Year Holiday** for Hydropower projects affecting commercial operation.

## 4. How to Apply?

1.  **Register:** Ensure your company is registered at the OCR and has a PAN.
2.  **Audit:** Keep your tax filings and audit reports up to date. The government will not lend to non-compliant businesses.
3.  **Proposal:** Write a solid business plan. *Need help? Our analysts can draft a bankable project proposal for you.*
