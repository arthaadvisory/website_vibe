*Practical guide for small and medium enterprises to optimize tax liabilities legally.*

---

Running a Small or Medium Enterprise (SME) in Nepal requires more than just operational efficiency; it demands financial discipline. With the **Fiscal Year 2025/26** bringing new updates to the Income Tax Act, business owners have fresh opportunities to optimize their tax position.

Effective tax planning isn't about evasion—it's about leveraging the law to reinvest your hard-earned profits back into your growth. Here are five strategic moves every Nepali SME should consider this year.

## 1. Optimize Your Presumptive Tax Regime Selection

For smaller entities, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) offers a simplified "Presumptive Tax" scheme. Choosing the right tier here is critical.

*   **Turnover up to NPR 3 Million**: You pay a flat tax (e.g., NPR 7,500 in metro areas). This saves massive administrative costs.
*   **Turnover NPR 3M - 10M**: You pay a percentage of turnover (usually 1%).

**Strategy**: If your profit margins are **low** (e.g., trading goods with thin margins), the presumptive turnovers tax is beneficial. However, if you are running at a loss or have very high operational costs, opting for a normal audit-based filing (where you pay tax only on *net profit*) might actually result in **zero tax**. Calculate both before registering.

## 2. Leverage Section 11 Exemptions

Many SMEs miss out on "Section 11" tax holidays because they assume they don't qualify. The FY 2025/26 budget has expanded these scopes:

*   **Startups**: If verified by the Department of Industry, startups (turnover < 100M) can enjoy a **100% income tax exemption for 5 years**.
*   **IT & Exports**: Exporting IT services (BPO, software, design) entitles you to a **75% exemption**, effectively lowering your tax rate to just ~5%.
*   **Manufacturing**: Special industries get a **20% discount** on the applicable rate.

## 3. Strategic Asset Purchasing (Depreciation)

In Nepal, *when* you buy an asset matters as much as *what* you buy.

*   **First 6 Months (Shrawan - Poush)**: Claim **100%** depreciation for the year.
*   **Next 3 Months (Magh - Chaitra)**: Claim **2/3rds**.
*   **Last 3 Months (Baishakh - Ashad)**: Claim only **1/3rd**.

**Strategy**: If you are planning to buy a delivery van (Pool C) or computers (Pool B), ensure the purchase happens **before Poush end**. This maximizes your deductible expenses for the current year, lowering your taxable income. Manufacturing companies also get an **additional 1/3rd** depreciation allowance—ensure you claim it!

## 4. Master the "Loss Carry Forward"

Business is cyclical. If you faced a loss this year, the Income Tax Act allows you to carry this loss forward for **7 years** to offset future profits.

*   *Example*: If you lost NPR 5 Lakhs in Year 1 and made NPR 8 Lakhs profit in Year 2, your taxable income in Year 2 is only 3 Lakhs (8 - 5).

**Strategy**: Ensure your audit report clearly documents losses. Without proper documentation and filing, the IRD will not allow you to offset these losses in profitable years.

## 5. Compliance as a Cost-Saving Tool

The most expensive "tax" in Nepal is actually **fines and interest**.
*   **TDS Interest**: 15% per annum.
*   **VAT Non-Filing**: NPR 5,000 per month or higher.

**Strategy**: Automate your TDS deductions and VAT filings. Fines are *not* tax-deductible expenses—they come directly out of your post-tax pockets. Strict compliance is the easiest 20% return on investment you can make.
