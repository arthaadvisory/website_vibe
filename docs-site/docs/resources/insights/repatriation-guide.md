For foreign investors, the ease of "Exit" is as important as "Entry". Nepal's Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA) guarantees the right to repatriate, but the bureaucratic process can be daunting.

## What Can You Repatriate?
1.  **Dividends:** Proportional to your share of investment.
2.  **Sale of Shares:** Proceeds from exiting the venture.
3.  **Royalties/Fees:** Management fees, technology transfer fees, or trademark royalties (must be pre-approved).
4.  **Loan Principal & Interest:** If you provided a foreign loan (ECB).

## The Approval Process (The "Three-Approvals" System)

### Step 1: Sectoral Approval (DOI / IBN)
Before sending money, you must have your initial investment and Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) recorded at the Department of Industry (DOI) or Investment Board Nepal (IBN).
*   *Requirement:* Evidence that the money *came in* via banking channels originally ("Niyantran" letter).

### Step 2: Tax Clearance (The Big Hurdle)
You cannot send a rupee out without a clean chit from the taxman.
*   **Full Audit:** Your company must undergo a full tax audit for the relevant years.
*   **Dividend Tax:** Ensure 5% (or treaty rate) Dividend WHT is deducted and paid.

### Step 3: Central Bank (NRB) Recommendation
The final gatekeeper is Nepal Rastra Bank. You need to apply to the Foreign Exchange Management Department.
*   **Documents Needed:**
    *   Board Minute approving dividend.
    *   Audit Report.
    *   Tax Clearance Certificate.
    *   Evidence of FDI recording.

## Common Roadblocks
*   **Missing "Niyantran" Letter:** If you didn't record your initial investment entry at NRB, you are stuck. Retroactive recording is difficult.
*   **Working Capital Issues:** If your company has negative reserves, you cannot declare dividends even if you have cash.
