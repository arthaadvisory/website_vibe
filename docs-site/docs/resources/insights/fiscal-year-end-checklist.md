As the Nepali fiscal year draws to a close (Ashad end), accounting teams across the country go into overdrive. To ensure a smooth audit and avoid tax penalties later, here is our essential **Fiscal Year End Closing Checklist**.

## 1. 🧾 Tax Reconciliation
*   **VAT Reconciliation:** Match your Sales Ledger with your Monthly VAT Returns totals. Any difference? Investigate now.
*   **TDS Verification:** Cross-check your ETDS login. Have all deducted TDS amounts been deposited? 
*   **Advance Tax:** Ensure you have paid at least **100% of your estimated tax liability** by Ashad end to avoid Section 119 fees.

## 2. 📦 Inventory Valuation
*   **Physical Count:** Mandate a stock count on the last day of Ashad.
*   **Valuation Method:** Confirm you are using Cost or Net Realizable Value (NRV), whichever is lower (NAS 2).
*   **Slow Moving Stock:** Identify obsolete items for potential write-off (requires IRD notification).

## 3. 🏦 Bank & Loan Confirmation
*   **Reconcile All Accounts:** Not just the main operating account.
*   **Loan Statements:** Obtain interest certificates and loan balance confirmations.
*   **NRB Compliance:** Check if your working capital loan exceeds 25% of your turnover.

## 4. 📉 Depreciation & Amortization
*   **Fixed Asset Register:** Update for any additions/disposals during the year.
*   **Capitalization:** Ensure major repairs that extend asset life are capitalized, not expensed.

## 5. 💰 Provisions & Accruals
*   **Staff Bonus:** Provision 10% for staff bonus (if profitable).
*   **Gratuity & Leave:** update actuarial valuation liabilities.
*   **Expenses:** Accrue for audit fees, electricity, and rent for Ashad.

## 6. 🤝 Vendor & Customer Balances
*   **Confirmation Letters:** Send out balance confirmation requests to major debtors and creditors. This is the #1 audit evidence.
