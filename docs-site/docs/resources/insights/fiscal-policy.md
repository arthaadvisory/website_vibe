The new fiscal policy introduces several changes aimed at boosting the SME sector while expanding the tax base and simplifying compliance obligations.

## Key Highlights

- **Tax holidays for startups** — Industries registered in underdeveloped districts may qualify for up to 10 years of income tax exemption under the latest Industrial Enterprises Act amendments.
- **Reduced import duties on raw materials** — Manufacturing-oriented importers can benefit from reduced customs duty on select inputs, particularly in agro-processing and IT hardware.
- **New VAT compliance requirements** — The IRD has introduced mandatory e-billing for businesses with turnover exceeding NPR 50 Lakh, effective from Shrawan 2083.
- **Social Security Fund (SSF) expansion** — Employer contribution rates remain at 20%, but the penalty structure for late deposits has been tightened.

## What This Means for Your Business

The policy shifts the government's strategy toward incentivizing formal registration and digital compliance. Businesses that proactively adopt e-billing and formalize their employment contracts will be best positioned to access the new incentive structure.
