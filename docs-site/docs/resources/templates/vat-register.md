## Structure of the Register

### 1. Purchase Register (Khareed Khata)
| Cloud | Date | Supplier Name | PAN No. | Taxable Value | VAT Amount | Exempt Import |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Why?** | To claim Input VAT Credit. |

### 2. Sales Register (Bikri Khata)
| Date | Invoice No. | Customer Name | PAN No. | Sales (Taxable) | VAT Collected | Export Sales |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Why?** | To calculate Output VAT Liability. |

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes
*   **Missing PAN:** You cannot claim VAT credit if the supplier's PAN is missing.
*   **English Dates:** The IRD system (CBMS) requires Nepali dates (BS).
*   **Abbreviated Names:** Use the full legal name of the supplier.

## Filing Deadline
*   **Monthly**: By the 25th of the following month (e.g., Baishakh VAT return is due by 25th Jestha).
*   **Tri-mesterly**: For small taxpayers (turnover < 20 Lakhs), every 4 months.
