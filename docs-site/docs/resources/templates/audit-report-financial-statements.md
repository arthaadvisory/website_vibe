## 1. Independent Auditor's Report

```markdown
**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT**

To the Shareholders / Board of Directors of [Company Name]
[Address of the Company]

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinion**
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of [Company Name] (the "Company"), which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at [Date] (e.g., Ashad 31, 2080), the Statement of Profit or Loss (Income Statement), Statement of Cash Flows, and Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at [Date], and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Nepal Financial Reporting Standards (NFRS) / Nepal Accounting Standards (NAS) and comply with the Companies Act, 2063 and prevailing laws.

**Basis for Opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with Nepal Standards on Auditing (NSAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the *Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements* section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Handbook of The Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Key Audit Matters**
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

| **Key Audit Matter** | **How our Audit addressed the Key Audit Matter** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Matter 1 Title]** <br> *Description of the matter, why it is significant, and reference to related notes.* | *Description of audit procedures performed to address the matter.* |
| **[Matter 2 Title]** <br> *Description...* | *Description...* |

*[Note: If there are no Key Audit Matters to communicate, this section may be omitted or stated as "We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report."]*

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements**
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with NAS/NFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with NSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**
We have audited the attached financial statements accordingly and report that:
1. We have obtained prompt replies to our queries including satisfactory explanation during the course of the audit.
2. In our opinion, proper books of accounts have been maintained by the Company.
3. The Financial Statements dealt with by this report are in agreement with the books of accounts maintained by the Company.
4. We have not come across any fraudulence in the accounts on our sample examination of the books of accounts of the current year.
5. We have issued a separate management letter comprising of our observations and recommendations.
6. [Other specific reporting requirements, e.g., under BAFIA, Insurance Act, etc.]
